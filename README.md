I developed a "Bank Marketing Prediction System" that predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on historical marketing campaign data.

The project includes:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Feature engineering (age/balance grouping)
- One-hot encoding & feature scaling
- Model training and evaluation
- Deployment as an interactive Streamlit web app

📌 Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Streamlit
